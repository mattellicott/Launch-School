**Polymorphism** refers to the ability of objects with different types to respond in different ways to the same message (or method invocation); that is, data of different types can respond to a common interface. It's a crucial concept in OO programming that can lead to more maintainable code.

When two or more object types have a method with the same name, we can invoke that method with any of those objects. When we don't care what type of object is calling the method, we're using polymorphism. Often, polymorphism involves inheritance from a common superclass.

**Polymorphism through inheritance**

**Polymorphism through duck typing**

Duck typing occurs when objects of different unrelated types both respond to the same method name.

**Encapsulation** lets us hide the internal representation of an object from the outside and only expose the methods and properties that users of the object need. We can use method access control to expose these properties and methods through the public (or external) interface of a class: its public methods.
