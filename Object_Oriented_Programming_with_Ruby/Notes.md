**Object Oriented Programming**
Often referred to as OOP, is a programming paradigm that was created to deal with the growing complexity of large software systems. Programmers found out very early on that as applications grew in complexity and size, they became very difficult to maintain. One small change at any point in the program would trigger a ripple effect of errors due to dependencies throughout the entire program.

Programmers needed a way to create containers for data that could be changed and manipulated without affecting the entire program. They needed a way to section off areas of code that performed certain procedures so that their programs could become the interaction of many small parts, as opposed to one massive blob of dependency.
