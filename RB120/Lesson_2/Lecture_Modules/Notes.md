**Single Inheritance** is a limitation of class inheritance in Ruby in that a class can only directly sub-class from one super class.<br>

**Multiple Inheritance** is a functionality of some programming languages to allow classes to directly inherit from multiple classes.<br>

**Mixins or Mixing In** is how Ruby offers multiple inheritance, by allowing an unlimited number of modules to be mixed in.
