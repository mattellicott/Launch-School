                                  RULES

         1. The game is played on a grid that's 4 by 4 squares.

         2. You choose which mark you would like, X or O. Players take
            turns putting their marks in empty squares.

         3. First to move is chosen randomly, and then alternates
            after each round.

         4. Getting 4 marks in a row(up, down, across, or diagonally)
            earns 2 points.

         5. Marking all four corners earns 1 point.

         6. When no more points can be earned, the round ends.

         7. Points are calculated at the end of the round. The game
            ends when one, or both, players reaches 10 points.
